----------------------------------------

Approxmap is an algorithm used for exploratory data analysis of sequential data. When we have longitudinal data and we want to find out the underlying patterns, we use approxmap. `approxmapR` aims to provide a consistent and tidy api for using the algorithm in R. This vignette aims to demonstrate the basic workflow of approxmapR.

A description of the package can be found at:
vignettes/approxmapR-getting-started.Rmd

A Description of Functions within the package is available at "Document_approxmap.R"

----------------------------------------

The folder "data" contains two relevant datasets used for testing purposes.

"demo1.csv" contains a smaller dataset to practice testing the clustering algorithm on.
"mvad.rda" contains the larger dataset to practice testing the algorithm.
