Known Bugs and Issues for ApproxmapR
====================================


find_optimal_k()
----------------

[DESCRIPTION]
  An error is produced when finding the optimal K value for the K-NN algorithm
  (clustering = 'k-nn'). The error occurs when a K value produces 1 cluster.

[TEST CODE; Version 0.2.0]

  data("demo1")
  demo1 <- data.frame(do.call("rbind", strsplit(as.character(demo1$id.date.item), ",")))
  names(demo1) <- c("id", "period", "event")
  head(demo1)

  demo1 %>% aggregate_sequences(format = "%m/%d/%Y",
                                unit = "month",
                                n_units =1,
                                summary_stats=FALSE) %>%
            find_optimal_k(clustering = 'k-nn', min_k = 2, max_k = 10,
                            use_cache = FALSE, validation_measure = 'silhouette')

[ERROR]
  Error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors

[SUSPECTED CAUSE]
  The current error is believed to be caused from the -cluster.stats()- function
  from the fpc library. The error is caused by the use of the $ operator to select
  a column (vector) from a data frame.

[POTENTIAL FIX]
  Some time was spent trying to correct the issue, but no luck within the allocated
  time and attempts. The correction attempts were switching the column (vector)
  selection from dataframe$column_of_interest to dataframe[["column_of_interest"]]
  within the -find_optimal_k- function and the -cluster.stats- function source code.

  This appeared to correct the issue above but other issues resulted from the
  change. Given that this only occurred with the small sample data set (demo1)
  from aprroxmapR, attention was focused elsewhere.
