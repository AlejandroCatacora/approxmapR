This document is to provide basic description for an understanding of the supported
cluster validation measures.


- Average Distance Between Clusters
    -The average distance between clusters (FPC Documentation)

- Average Distance Within Clusters
    - The average distance within clusters (reweighted so that every observation, rather than every distance, has the same weight) (FPC Documentation)

- Average Distance Within Clusters / Average Distance Between Clusters
    - Average Distance Within Clusters /Average Distance Between (FPC Documentation)

- Within Cluster Sum of Squares
    - A generalization of the within clusters sum of squares (k-means objective function), which is obtained if d is a Euclidean distance matrix. For general distance measures, this is half the sum of the within cluster squared dissimilarities by the cluster size (FPC Documentation)

- Dunn Index
    - Primary reference (Halkidi, Batistaki, & Vazirgiannis, 2001)
    - Minimum Separation / Maximum Diameter
        - Minimum separation is minimum cluster separation
            - A vector of cluster wise minimum distances of a point in the cluster to a point of another cluster
        - Maximum diameter is maximum cluster diameter
            - A vector of cluster diameters (maximum within cluster distances)
    - High values on the Dunn Index indicate the presence of compact a well-separated clusters

- Silhouette Index
    - Primary reference (Halkidi, Batistaki, & Vazirgiannis, 2001)
    - “The silhouette width of a point measures the proximity of the point to its own cluster relative to the proximity to other clusters” (Halkidi, Batistaki, & Vazirgiannis, 2001)
    - The silhouette index is the average silhouette width of clusters
        - Ranges from -1 to 1
            - Closer to -1 indicates that the point is on average closer to another cluster than the one to which it belongs
            - Closer to 1 indicates that the point’s average distance to its own cluster is smaller than any other cluster
    - Higher the silhouette index, indicates the presence of compact and separated clusters


Validation measure selectin is used in find_optimal_k() and can be selected
through the validation_measure parameter.
